						<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p>I was born in Manhattan, NY to an immigrant mother from Guyana and a Puerto Rican father. I grew up in Brooklyn, NY. I went to Hebrew Educational Society for pre-kindergarten. Afterwards, I went down the street to P.S.115 for kindergarten - fifth grade. For Junior High I went to I.S.211. In eighth grade I got into Academy for Young Writers, and that’s where I spent the rest of grade school. Recently I moved from Brooklyn, NY to Long Island, but most of my family still lives in Brooklyn. I’ve visited my mother’s home country of Guyana, and the culture is a lot different than it is in America. However, I have never visited Puerto Rican.</p>
						<h3>College</h3>
						<p>During my first semester at the University of Rochester, I took Beginning American Sign Language, CSC170, CSC161, and MTH140. That semester I made Dean’s List and was invited to join the National Society of Collegiate Scholars. The following semester I took CSC171, MTH150, Beginning American Sign Language II, and WRT105 RAGE!. My humanities cluster is American Sign Language and I’m still deciding my Social Science cluster. I am currently deciding between Gender and Women’s studies and Anthropology. This semester I’m taking Intro to Medical Anthropology, which can be used towards either cluster. I’m doing a human and computer interactions track, with the goal of getting a Bachelor of Arts for Computer Science.</p>

						<h3>About me</h3>
						<p>I was born in Rochester, and I’ve lived here my whole life. I live in Brighton with my parents and my sister, who is in her senior year of high school. I have been playing classical piano since I was 4 years old, and it’s something that I’ve always enjoyed. I wouldn’t say that I’m the next Mozart or anything though! One of my favorite composers is Debussy- I really like romantic-era music. I took several music theory classes when I was in high school. When I graduate, I’d like to go somewhere new. I’m not exactly sure where I want to go to grad school yet, but I’ll figure it out… eventually. In the meantime I’d really like to visit Europe, Australia, Africa, South America… there’s so many places I haven’t been yet. I just need to find the time (and money) to do it.</p>
						<h3>College</h3>
						<p>I’m a junior at the University of Rochester. I am majoring in computer science with a minor in Japanese. When I first came to the U of R, I didn’t know anything about any of those subjects, but I’ve learned a lot in just two years. When I first came to Rochester, my intended major was Physics and Astronomy. I took an intro to computer science class my first semester, and I really enjoyed it. Eventually, I decided to major in computer science. I also still love astronomy, so I’d like to have a career related to that industry in the future.</p>

						<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p>I was born in Boston, MA, but I’ve lived in Rochester, NY since I was 6. I remember a lot from Boston: riding the subways with my brother and dad, going to school, kids’ soccer leagues, babysitters, family friends, playgrounds, and much more. The beginning of Harry Potter is set in my first house, because that’s where my babysitter read it to me. And of course I remember my family – my mom, dad, and older brother – but they came with me to Rochester. In elementary school I was a pretty busy kid. Both my parents worked full time, so after school I went to an after-school program until about 6pm. Then, most nights we’d come home for a rushed dinner and then drive off again for some activity: soccer, gymnastics, basketball, swimming, violin lessons, violin classes, or my brother’s baseball games.</p>
						<h3>College</h3>
						<p>College was the first time that I could choose pretty much all of what I wanted to study, and I loved that. Every semester I spent hours and hours looking at the course catalogs, emailing professors for syllabi, sitting in on way more courses than I was going to take, and trying to make decisions (which I’m bad at). I didn’t declare my major until fall of my junior year, when I created my own major (so I never really decided anyway). Although the library has been my second home, I’ve also been pretty involved in a couple clubs (Students for a Democratic Society, Greenspace, and Partners in Reading especially), and kept up violin for the first three years.</p>
